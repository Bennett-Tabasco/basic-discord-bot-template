Based on the old version, this is the rewritten version of the template for the basic discord.py bot
, you can modify stuff on your own for personal (or commercial) using purposes.

# Overview

Because this is a rewritten version of the old version, 
it will inherit all of the features and undetected bugs/issues from the old version.
Most of them have been detected and fixed, somes are not.

Some of the old features have been improved for a better experience to work with the bot development process
or for better user experiences.

# Features

1. Improved the structure of how the server's prefixes should be stored. This improvement was meant
for better readability.

Example:

Old structure:
{
    "server's id (string)": "server's prefix",
    "server's id (string)": "server's prefix"
}

New structure (not available anymore):
{
    "guilds": {
        "server's name": {
            "id": server's id (integer)
            "prefix": "server's prefix"
        },

        "server's name": {
            "id": server's id (integer)
            "prefix": "server's prefix"
        }
    }
}

New structure (revamped):
{
    "guilds": {
        "server's id": {
            "name": server's name (string)
            "prefix": "server's prefix" (string)
        },

        "server's id": {
            "name": server's name (string)
            "prefix": "server's prefix" (string)
        }
    }
}

2. The bot will also load all of the server's informations and write them to a JSON file
that it's currently in if it hasn't possess those informations yet.

3. Music commands are now available on this version.

4. This version uses a .env via enviroment variables file to store client's token.
This will be more secure than pasting it directly to the bot.py file

5. Background task is now available, the bot will change its activity and status every specified amount of time
; however, you can modify it as you like.
