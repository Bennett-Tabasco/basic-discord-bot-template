# basic-discord-bot-template
This is just a template for a discord bot scripted in discord.py, feel free to make changes on your own.

My code is mostly based on Lucas's code so be sure to check him out in this link https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-zOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg


if you're about to download my project, just download everything, make sure that everything is in its place

if the bot sent duplicate messages or the command doesn't work after you commited changes even if your syntax is correct, just regenarate the token and run the bot with that new token
