# basic-discord-bot-template
This is just a template for a discord bot scripted in discord.py, feel free to make changes on your own.

if you're about to download my project, just download everything, make sure that everything is in its place



if the bot sent duplicate messages or the command doesn't work after you commited changes even if your syntax is correct, just regenarate the token and run the bot with that new token


update notes (4th june 2021 12:00 AM):
- added kick, ban, tempban and unban commands
- permissions-only commands are now available
